In this site you will find some tutorials and exercises that I use with my students. 

This site was done with [Jekyll] and the [Just the Docs] theme. If you want to do the same, go ahead and "[use this template]" and follow the instructions through the [README] file. Check the documentation at [Just the Docs].
